    <center><h2><u>SAFETY AND SECURITY</u></h2>
        <img src="safe.jpeg" alt="responsive webite" class="img-fluid" height="500" width="800">
    <br><br>
    <p><h5>The safety and security of our guests is our top priority. Our excellent record of safe operation throughout Carnival's 40-plus year history, and the comprehensive safety standards we continue to live up to every day, proves that commitment.
      All our officers and crew undergo comprehensive regular safety and emergency training that meets or exceeds all regulatory requirements.
      Our crew members undergo specific training to handle emergency situations and help our guests. Crew roles, responsibilities and duties are clearly defined and assigned to handle any emergency on board.
      The average sea farer experience of our captains is 32.6 years (23.6 years with our Cruise Line and nine years prior to joining us)
      All Cruise ships are designed and operated in compliance with strict requirements of international law, which ensure that they are able to remain safe under a variety of adverse conditions.
      All of our ships are equipped with the most advanced navigation technology, and our officers are expertly trained in its use. As part of our comprehensive bridge team management system, we always have multiple people on the bridge watch.
    Additionally, it is our normal procedure to conduct a mandatory lifeboat drill at the start of every voyage. The purpose of the drill is to ensure that guests know where to go and what to do in case of emergency. On Carnival Cruise Line's ships, the drill is normally conducted prior to sailing.
    Our lifeboats are tested during regularly-scheduled drills to make certain that they are in proper working order. Lifeboats carry survival kits with food and water, first aid supplies, and signaling and communication devices. Additionally, we conduct a full scale lifeboat exercise every month, where we simulate emergency conditions and our technical teams practice all operational procedures. Our life boats are routinely inspected, tested and certified by a third-party organization.
    We also ensure that the number of lifejackets, lifeboats and life rafts on each Carnival ship exceed the number required, based on the ship's maximum capacity for passengers and crew.</h5></p></center>
